    checkout fhir download for IG publisher
[] TODO: HIGH: Use correct types for Extensions
[] TODO: ???: use order of attributes; is in fhirProperties
[] TODO: MED: move sample-ig > vgh-ig ig folder and run publisher from there
[] TODO: LOW: maybe check for extensions or profilenames with different casing! Should be the same.
[] TODO: MED: describe steps
[] TODO: MED: create checklist for tool component installation
[] TODO: @Jay fhirProperties is missing some definitions, e.g. DocumentReference and MedicationDispense (has space in it), 
    but also expansion of types like Patient.name is in there, but not Patient.address to address.use etc.
[] TODO: LOW: provide example values so that IG Publisher can generate Examples
    See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/FHIR/IG+Publisher+Documentation#IGPublisherDocumentation-ProcessingOptions
    add to ig.in "gen-examples = true"
    @Jay: add example values to tables
[] VAPatient is Patient resource but there is a MedicationOrder in line 185; check initial Resource!

Questions to chat.fhir.org:
Q: Why is description for a Resource not taken from the StructureDefinition as it does for Extensions?
  description shows up in Artifact index but not in Artiface page... For Extension it does work.
Q: How do I fix: "No value set found at Encounter.language (url = 'http://tools.ietf.org/html/bcp47')"?
Q: Why is ElementDefinition.name and ElementDefinition.id overwritten with the value of ElementDefinition.path? -> This will cause a duplicate id ERROR.

---------------

Coverpage =25 /home/michael/eclipse-workspace/vha-ampl-fhir-ig/scripts/output/StructureDefinition-VAPurpleHeartStatusProfile-Observation.json
Makes IG publisher go full cpu load at "Terminology server: Check for supported code systems ..."
Caused by the fixedvalues in there with double ..

-------------

IG Publisher architecture:
- templates in the sample-ig will automatically update
-- [] Unless you set a specific version in ig.ini. How????
- there might be more requirements to myig.xml e.g. parameters like (some are now in ig.ini)
-- <parameter>
  <code value="releaselabel"/>
  <value value="CI Build"/>
  </parameter>
-- <parameter>
  <code value="copyrightyear"/>
  <value value="2020"/>
  </parameter>

-------------

Manually added type to generated jsons:
> fgrep "value[x]" input/resources
  { "path": "Observation.value[x]" }
  ..
  { "path": "Observation.valueQuantity" }

Manually adjusted in ConceptMap.json:
- conceptMapName: APPOINTMENT STATUS -> AppointmentStatus
- conceptMapName: CLINICAL DANGER LEVEL -> ClinicalDangerLevel
- Concept equavalence lossy > inexact

!! VERSIONS of components !!
Now running on Java1.8.* + Ruby2.3 + Jekyll3.8 (not install jekyll from apt!)
-- gem install jekyll --version 3.8 ; seems to fix gsub issue (cannot update to version 4 because of dependency with Mint ditro I use)
IG Publisher 1.0.61!
> java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -jar org.hl7.fhir.publisher-1.0.61.jar -ig ig.ini

------------------------
Mapping questions:
- pat-medOrder-ext: indication* <- there is a reason attribute that is for "indication" so this is not an extension but rather a fixed value
- 52.2-.08: requestDate -> MedicationOrder.dateWritten
- Choose: fixed values or constraint (xpath) -> look into slicing

------------------------
Questions and Answers:

Q: Checkout Shorthand for generating StructDefs/Extensions/Examples!
A: Not for now. Shorthand only supports R4 today.

Q: 2. We also need a 'package' or a 'group' - one that says, put this VAAllergyIntolerance profile together with these Provenance profiles. We'd publish as one profile if we could but we can't.
A: 2. There is ImplementationGuide.grouping and groupingId that is used for that.

  <grouping id="allergy">
    <name value="Allergy Group"/>	
  </grouping>

  and then for each resource in that group add <groupingId value="allergy"/>

Q: 3. Can we split up the Artifacts, a. specific profiles, b. extensions, c. value sets & maps?
A: 3. Expect this to happen automatically based on constrainedType="StructureDefinition", constrainedType="Extension", constrainedType="ValueSet"

!!!!
Q: How to do Extensions?

  In table now (up to version 4):
   FHIR R2 resource	FHIR R2 property
   "Patient" "extension: raceEthicityCollectionMethod"
   
  A: "Patient" "extension.raceEthicityCollectionMethod" <- if property startswith "extension." then this is an extension!

   @base: "<should match constrainedType>"
   @constrainedType: "Extension"
   @contextType: "resource(.property)"
   @context: [ "<ResourceName(s) where this Extension is applied on>" ]
   Use "special" paths in the mapping table and derive the above attributes.
   !!?? kind: "datatype" or "resource" <-- how do I know from the current table?

  For the "Patient" "extension.raceEthicityCollectionMethod" example:
   @base: "http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/Extension"
   @constrainedType: "Extension"
   @contextType: "resource(.property)"
   @context: [ "Patient" ]
   @fullUri: "http://va.gov/fhir/StructureDefinition/reactionDateEntered"

   AND
   > How to include the extension in a profile. Like race in argonaut patient:
   > http://www.fhir.org/guides/argonaut/r2/StructureDefinition-argo-patient.xml.html

        "path" : "Patient.extension",
        "name" : "reactionDateEntered",
        "short" : "Extension",
        "definition" : "An Extension",
        "base" : {
          "path" : "Patient.extension"
        },
        "type" : [
          {
            "code" : "Extension",
            "profile" : [
              "http://va.gov/fhir/StructureDefinition/reactionDateEntered"
            ]
          }
        ]
!!!!

Q: How to get the "extensions" page and format for the Extensions???
A: done created extensions.xml and using https://jekyllrb.com/docs/step-by-step/05-includes/

Q: 0. figure out how the ig-publisher auto includes some resources and not everything; now have to explicitly put in myig.xml
A: 0. just not put the <resources> tag in there includes all resources in the resources directory. Downside is that you cannot do custom grouping then.

Q: Where to put the mappings of the VAValueSets? ConceptMap and will that render in the IG?
A: Yes. Renders in IG and mappings go in ConceptMaps

Q: Unable to find profile '' at MedicationDispense.medication or MedicationOrder.medication
  Happens for all profiles that profile these resources and have a medication[x] thing.
  A: Stating the type solves the issue.
      {
	    "path": "MedicationOrder.medicationCodeableConcept"
    },
  - pat-medOrder-ext-MedicationOrder
  - pat-medOrder-MedicationDispense
  - pat-medDispense-MedicationDispense
  - pat-medDispense-ext-MedicationDispense

---------------------------------
Restrictions in the table
- Data_x0020_Elements used as element.short should not start or end with space
- Type must be in path when applicable, e.g. for Observation.value, effective, medication, etc.
- whitespaces cannot be in paths
- resourcename must start with a capital and be an existing resource
- a lot of "Error in snapshot generation: Differential for <profileId> has an element id: <path> that is not marked with a snapshot match - check validity of differential (including order)"
  Those are not existing paths!
  Not blocking for IG publication.
- when property is a [x] property you need a path (BEFORE THAT ONE) with the type added, e.g. for pt-vitals-Observation!
    {
	    "path": "Observation.valueQuantity"
    },
  This is BLOCKING for IG publication (during snapshot generation).

- AllergyIntolerance.patient.reference.display and then a mapping is not valid
-- should be a profile on Patient with a mapping added to patient.display: YES
-- [] paths cannot go beyond reference?! Check with Grahame..

-----------------
Validate the profiles first through:
POST to https://r2.smarthealthit.org//StructureDefinition/$validate
Helps a little bit, doesnot check for valid paths.

or the "official" validator
> java -jar org.hl7.fhir.validator-4.1.19.jar -version 1.0.2 -snapshot input/resources/StructureDefinition-pt-Patient.json 

!! TODO: Turns out that the "Error in snapshot generation" is caused by the order of the elements. 
!! Turns out the order of the element paths must be in the order it has in the base resource property and datatype attributes.
