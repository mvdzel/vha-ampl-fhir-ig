  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
This implementation guide illustrates how to build FHIR resources to support the Veterans Health Administration Advanced Medication Platform (AMPL) application.

The profiles in this guide assemble the VistA elements required by the AMPL application and specifies maps to FHIR for ease of reference.

<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>
VHA VistA data elements have been mapped to FHIR resource elements in the following order:
<ol>
<li>Elements available in the Argonaut Data Query IG (DSTU2)</li>
<li>Elements otherwise available in DSTU2 core</li>
<li>Elements that can be represented as "ancillary" resources, such as Observation, Provenance, or AuditEvent</li>
<li>Elements available in DSTU2 extensions</li>
<li>Elements available in later releases, represented as FHIR core extensions</li>
<li>Elements not available in later releases, represented as VHA extensions</li>
</ol>

For each element required by the AMPL application
<ol>
<li>The mapped FHIR element is tagged as "must support"</li>
<li>The mapped FHIR element is given a map to the source VistA element</li>
<li>For sliced elements, discriminators are assigned</li>
<li>For coded elements, system identifiers are provided</li>
</ol>

Note that elements modeled as ancillary (e.g., Provenance) cannot be modeled in a one profile with the main resource. The AllergyIntolerance requirements, for instance, include an element for verifier and verification date/time, which we model as Provenance. However, the AllergyIntolerance profile cannot stipulate a related Provenance resource, as the relationship is incoming. To represent both resources in one profile, we would have to profile Provenance with a defined reference to the AllergyIntolerance. This seemed incorrect, and it would not work in cases where we have more than one Provenance requirement. Instead, we profile VAAllergyIntolerance, and we profile VAAllergyIntoleranceProvenance, and we include both profiles in a "use case" in this guide to illustrate how they fit together.
